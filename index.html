        <h2>Passing Values to Functions with Arguments</h2>
        <p>Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.</p>
        <p>CODE 1.1</p>
        <code>function functionWithArgs(x,y) {
            console.log(x+y);
        }
        functionWithArgs:functionWithArgs(1,2);
        functionWithArgs:functionWithArgs(7,9);</code>
        <div class="code">In CODE 1.1 x and y are parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments can use with parameters.</div>
        <h2> Global Scope and Functions</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again.</p>
        <div class="remb">*You should always declare your variables with var*</div>
