        <h2 id="argument">Passing Values to Functions with Arguments</h2>
        <p>Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.</p>
        <p>CODE 1.1</p>

        <div class="code">In CODE 1.1 x and y are parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments can use with parameters.</div>

        <h2> Global Scope and Functions</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again.</p>
        </div>
        <p>*You should always declare your variables with var*</p>
        
        <div class="3">
        <h2> Local Scope and Functions</h2>
        <p>Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.</p>
        <p>CODE 1.2</p>
        <code>function myLocalScope(){
            var myVar="Visible"
            console.log('Inside my local scope, I am' , myVar);
        }
        myLocalScope();
        console.log('Outside my local scope,I am', myVar);</code>
        </div>
        <p>*You will see that myVar is undefined in console when it is outside from fuction <br> !When you copy the CODE 1.2 and run in browser you will see syntax error in console.</p>

        <div class="4">
            <h2>Global vs. Local Scope in Functions</h2>
            <p>It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.</p>
            <p>CODE 1.3</p>
            <code>
                //Global variable
                var transport="Bus";
                
                function myChoice() {
                    //Local variable within function
                    var transport="Taxi";
                    return transport;
                }
                myChoice();
                console.log(myChoice());</code>
        </div>
        <p>*You must use return statement to add local variable if it is same to global variable*</p>

        <div class="5">
            <h2>Return a Value from a Function with Return</h2>
            <p>We can pass values into a function with <a href="#argument">argument</a>. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.</p>
            <p>CODE 1.4</p>
            <code>function timesTen(num){
                return num*10;
            }
            
            var tenIntonum=timesTen(10);
            var fiveIntonum=timesTen(5);
            var zeroIntonum=timesTen(0);
            
            console.log(tenIntonum, fiveIntonum, zeroIntonum);
        </code>
        </div>

        <div class="6">
            <h2>Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function</h2>
            <p>A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.</p>
            <p>CODE 1.5</p>
            <code>
                var sum = 0;
                function addThree() {
                sum = sum + 3; 
                }
                var sum = 1;
                function addFive() {
                sum= sum + 5;
                }

                console.log(addThree());
                console.log(addFive());
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>*If I don't add return statement in function it will display other value not undefined value.</p>

        <div class="7">
            <h2>Assignment with a Returned Value</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).</p>
            <p>*If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.*</p>
            <p>This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.</p>
            <p>CODE 1.6</p>
            <code>
                var processed=0;
                function processArg(num){
                    return (num+3)/7;
                }
                
                processed=processArg(4);
                
                console.log(processed);

            <h2>Stand in Line</h2>
            <p>In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.</p>
            <p>So let write program like this</p>
            <p>Code 1.7</p>

        <div class="9">
            <h2>Understanding Boolean Values</h2>
            <p>Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.</p>
            <p>Code 1.8</p>
            <img src="\image\code_1.8.png" alt="Code 1.8 fig">
        </div>
        <p>*Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.*</p>

        <div class="10">
            <h2>Use Conditional Logic with If Statements</h2>
            <p>If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.</p>
            <p>When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.</p>
            <p>Pseudocode</p>
            <blockquote>
                if (<i>condition is true</i>){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>statement is excuted </i><br>}

            <h2>Difference between Equality Operator and Strict Equaltiy operator</h2>
            <p>There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not.</p>
            <p>CODE 2.0</p>
            <p>Equaltiy Operator</p>
            <img src="\image\code_2.0.png" alt="Code 2.0 fig">
            <p>Strict equaltiy operator</p>
            <img src="\image\code_2.0SEO.png" alt="CODE 2.0SEO fig">
        </div>
        <p>*Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.*<br>* In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as "Type Coercion". Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:*</p>
        <div class="code">In CODE 2.0, thirdUserInput value is not a number.Even if the function condition is equal to number value the thirdUserInput string value is still working with function condition equal to number value.<br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="11">
            <p>Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

                If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="12">
            <h2>Comparison with the Inequality Operator</h2>
            <p>The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.</p>
            <p>1!=2      //true</p>
            <p>1!="1"    //false</p>
            <p>1!='1'    //false</p>

            <h2>Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator</h2>
            <p>The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.</p>
            <p>3 !== 3   =>false </p>

            <p>The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.</p>

            <h2> Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements </h2>
            <p>If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.</p>

            <h2> Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements</h2>
            <p>In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.</p>
