        <h2>Passing Values to Functions with Arguments</h2>
        <p>Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.</p>
        <p>CODE 1.1</p>
        <code>function functionWithArgs(x,y) {
            console.log(x+y);
        }
        functionWithArgs:functionWithArgs(1,2);
        functionWithArgs:functionWithArgs(7,9);</code>
        <div class="code">In CODE 1.1 x and y are parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments can use with parameters.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="2">
        <h2> Global Scope and Functions</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again.</p>
        </div>
        <p>*You should always declare your variables with var*</p>
        
        <div class="3">
        <h2> Local Scope and Functions</h2>
        <p>Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.</p>
        <p>CODE 1.2</p>
        <code>function myLocalScope(){
            var myVar="Visible"
            console.log('Inside my local scope, I am' , myVar);
        }
        myLocalScope();
        console.log('Outside my local scope,I am', myVar);</code>
        </div>
        <p>*You will see that myVar is undefined in console when it is outside from fuction <br> !When you copy the CODE 1.2 and run in browser you will see syntax error in console.</p>

        <div class="4">
            <h2>Global vs. Local Scope in Functions</h2>
            <p>It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.</p>
            <code>console.log("CODE 1.3");
                //Global variable
                var transport="Bus";
                
                function myChoice() {
                    //Local variable within function
                    var transport="Taxi";
                    return transport;
                }
                myChoice();
                console.log(myChoice());</code>
        </div>
        <p>*You must use return function to add local variable same to global variable*</p>
