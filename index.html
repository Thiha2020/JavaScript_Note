        <h2>Passing Values to Functions with Arguments</h2>
        <p>Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.</p>

        <code>function functionWithArgs(x,y) {
            console.log(x+y);
        }
        functionWithArgs:functionWithArgs(1,2);
        functionWithArgs:functionWithArgs(7,9);</code>
        <div class="code">In CODE 1.1 x and y are parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments can use with parameters.</div>
